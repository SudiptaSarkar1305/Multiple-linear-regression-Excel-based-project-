# Multiple-linear-regression-Excel-based-project-
Analyzing Factors Affecting Academic Performance using linear regression

#Project Overview:

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 1,000 students to predict their Performance Index based on various features.

Model Details:

Algorithm Used: Multiple Linear Regression

Key Techniques: Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation

Results: The model explains 98.87% of the variance in the Performance Index, indicating a strong predictive capability.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of multiple linear regression in analyzing student performance and identifying key influencing factors.
